## Project Overview

### Market Pain Point
Second-hand trading at CUHK is currently fragmented across disorganized social channels (Facebook, WeChat), lacking structured data for effective filtering. Informal comment threads create confusion regarding real-time item availability (Available vs. Sold), while the lack of location visibility causes logistical friction when arranging pickups between distant hostels.

### Solution
We propose a centralized, **multi-tenant SaaS marketplace**. Following the SaaS architecture, the system treats different Colleges (e.g., Shaw, New Asia, Wu Yee Sun) as distinct "Communities" (Tenants).

* **Core Workflow:** Students can list items either globally or restricted to their specific College community. The system manages the full lifecycle of an item (Available → Reserved → Sold) to prevent double-booking.
* **SaaS Angle:** Each College acting as a tenant can have custom listing rules (e.g., expiry times) and isolated views, ensuring relevant local trading while maintaining a university-wide search capability.

## Planned "N-1" Advanced Features

1.  **Real-Time Chat**
    * A WebSocket-based messaging system enabling secure, in-app negotiations without exchanging personal phone numbers.
2.  **Intelligent Search**
    * Fuzzy search capability handling typos and partial matches (e.g., "Calc" matches "Calculus") to significantly improve item discoverability.
3.  **Location Integration**
    * Visualizes seller hostel locations to help buyers assess logistical difficulty (e.g., distance for carrying items).
4.  **Price Analytics**
    * Interactive dashboards displaying historical price trends by category, empowering users to evaluate fair market value.
